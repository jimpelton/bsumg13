The In-flight Data Capture Software will consist of two individual programs:
 1. a gui frontend to provide an easy to use in-flight user interface, and 
 2. a robust C++ backend which will interface with all hardwawre devices and
    record data frome each device. The backend will perform logging of events.

Class Descriptions

SocketServer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on Boost.Asio. Listens on a socket for client commands and requests and
sends replys back to the client.

MessageFactory
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recieves a message type from the SocketServer and generates the appropriate Event
type to be Queued by the EventManager.

EventQueue
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Queue events and dispatch them when a Manager requests an event. Only the manager
knows if it should act on the event or not.

Event
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


MANAGERS

Manager <<abstract>>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interface to a manager. These should have a queue of events to be dispatched to
the objects being managed. The managed objects should have a queue that holds
the events until it is ready to be used. The managed item should be able to tell
if it wants to act on the event.


WriterManager (Manager)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manages the Writer specializations much like the AccessorManager. Recieves events
from an EventManager. Perhaps this class will be merged with the AccessorManager for
a more general class that can manage any type of object which contains some sort of
worker logic.

AccessorManager (Manager)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manages a group of Accessors. Schedules jobs according to priority and then
dispatches a thread to execute each of those jobs. Jobs should be defined in
the Accessor objects being managed. 

See also WriterManager, which might be merged into AccessorManager.

ACCESSORS

Accessor <<abstract>>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interface to any object designed to access some kind of hardware. Objects which
access any 3rd party hardware API's should implement this interface so that a
Manager object may control the Accessor.

PhidgetsAccessor (Accessor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specialization for the Phidgets API. Possibly this class will be extended to handle
specific types of Phidgets hardware.

NIAccessor (Accessor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specialization for the National Instruments API. Specifically, this class will need
to handle interfacing with the National Instruments ADC 6008 (check 6008 is correct.)

AptinaAccessor (Accessor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specialization for the Aptina hardware. Specifically, this class will need to handle
interfacing with the DEMO2X boards via Micron's MIDLIB2 API.

DebugAccessor (Accessor)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specialization of Accessor for generating debug and test data. Demonstration data
could also be generated in this class. A further specialization of this class could
also read from a file to generate the data, or perhaps this could be a special
"mode" for this particular specialization.

SocketAccessor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



WRITERS

Writer <<abstract>>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The interface for Writer objects which are managed by a WriterManager. This interface
should be specialized for the particular data type and destination--but this may
lead to possible class explosion, so a compact and succinct method for writing any
data to any destination needs to be investigated.

Possible destinations include: disk, socket and SQLite database.

BinaryWriter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writes binary data to some destination. This can probably include the TextWriter
functionality, or no distinction between the two may need to be made.

TextWriter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writes ASCII text data to some destination.

SQLiteWriter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writes data to an SQLite destination.

SocketWriter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writes data to a socket destination.
